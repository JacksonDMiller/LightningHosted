      <div class ='faqItem'>
        <h2>What is LightningHosted?</h2>
        <p>LightingHosted is an image hosting service that uses the bitcoin lightning network to share advertising
          revenue with users.</p>
      </div>
      <div class ='faqItem'>
        <h2>How does it work?</h2>
        <p>Upload an image you would like to share and we will give you a link. The link will show your image alongside
          some
          bitcoin-related ads. You will then receive a portion of the advertising revenue generated by those ads.</p>
      </div>
      <div class ='faqItem'>
        <h2>Why do I have to pay to upload an image?</h2>
        <p>We use a small lightning network payment as a deterrent to people abusing the service. After the image
          recevies 100 views the satoshis are credited to your account for withdrawal.</p>
      </div>
      <div class ='faqItem'>
        <h2>How can I become a sponsor?</h2>
        <p>If you have a Bitcoin-focused project you would like to advertise reach out to me at BitcoinAcolyte@gmail.com
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class ='faqItem'>
        <h2>What kind of content can I upload?</h2>
        <p>This service has a zero-tolerance policy against any kind of illegal images including copyrighted images. We
          also
          do not allow pornography. As a rule of thumb if it wouldn't be acceptable on a California beach it's not
          acceptable here.</p>
      </div>
      <div class ='faqItem'>
        <h2>How long does it take to get paid?</h2>
        <p>We are in beta so times will vary but we make withdrawals available to our users as soon as we are paid by
          our
          advertisers.</p>
      </div>
      <div class ='faqItem'>
        <h2>Where can I get a lighting wallet?</h2>
        <p>There are a number of great lighting wallets but if you are new we recommend <a class='link'
            href="https://bluewallet.io/">Bluewallet.</a> However, as you learn about lightning you will learn that
          bluewallet has some limitations and you may want to move on to a fully featured wallet in the future. </p>
      </div>
      <div class ='faqItem'>
        <h2>Is it safe?</h2>
        <p>No, both the Lightning Network and especially this service are in beta and mistakes are bound to happen.
          Please
          withdraw often and do not trust this service with any amount of money you would be upset to lose.</p>
      </div>
      <div class ='faqItem'>
        <h2>How accurate are estimated satoshis?</h2>
        <p>Unfortuantly not very, hopefully as the service grows we can make it more accurate.</p>
